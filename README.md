# Intro to Django routes 2 in class
Endpoints are the most important concept when it comes to backend web services. Based on the URL you route the request to the proper piece of code to service the request and return a response.

In the Django implementation, you have a default set of endpoints, but can have specific ones for the various applications that make your overall implementation.

*** Exercise 1:
*Create a new Django project using ```django-admin startproject route66_project```
*Add an application using ```python manage.py startapp route66```
*Import ```views``` into your base ```urls.py```


Add the following endpoints and responses:

*```mycity/``` that returns ```Memphis All Day!```
*```myeats/``` that returns the name of your favorite place for eats
